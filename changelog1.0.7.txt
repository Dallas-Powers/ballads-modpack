			!!! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING !!!

			With support for 1.13.x coming soon, I've made the first step and flattened all my blocks and items. This are the blocks/items affected:

			- Yellorite ore, Benitoite ore, Anglesite ore
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel metal blocks (and their item forms)
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel ingots and dusts
			- Benitoite and Anglesite crystals

			If you have those items in chests/storage/machines other then vanillas one YOU MUST move them to vanilla chests before updating or you end up loosing them.

			Many mods do not use the system vanilla have in place to address this kind of changes. Iron Chests form the Iron Chest mod are OK (if you are using version 1.12.2-7.0.59.842 or newer of Iron Chest the other chest types should be OK too)

	Industrial Renewal (went from IndustrialRenewal_1.12.2-0.8.0.jar to IndustrialRenewal_1.12.2-0.8.1.jar):

	Mouse Tweaks (went from [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.9 to [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10):
		[1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10:
			 * Added a new setting for switching between "smooth scrolling, minor issues" and "non-smooth scrolling, no issues", set to smooth scrolling by default. The second option fixes a number of issues where Mouse Tweaks seemingly scrolls "through" another mod's GUI (namely JEI): [1](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/2), [2](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/17), [3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mouse-tweaks/files/19). Unfortunately, enabling the second option also makes the item scrolling a little non-smooth. Considering that the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible, the setting was left at "smooth scrolling" by default. Huge thanks to [@mezz](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/mezz) for [contributing the fix](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/pull/20) and explaining the underlying input mechanics.
			 * Fixed Mouse Tweaks clicking "through" some mods' GUIs (namely JEI): read above for details. The fix is active regardless of the smooth/non-smooth scrolling setting value.
			 * Added tooltips to all settings in the Forge Mod Options menu.
			 * Bumped the required Java version to 8. If this is a problem, please open an issue, it's possible to bring it back down to 6.

	OpenBlocks Elevator (went from ElevatorMod-1.12.2-1.3.6.jar to ElevatorMod-1.12.2-1.3.8.jar):
