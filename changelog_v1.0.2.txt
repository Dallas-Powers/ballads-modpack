	Buildcraft (went from BuildCraft 7.99.19 to buildcraft-all-7.99.21.jar):
		buildcraft-all-7.99.21.jar:
			Improvements:

			 *  [#4315] Allow the oil dimension and biome exclusion lists to be treated as whitelists instead.
			 * Toggle either "worldgen.oil.excludedBiomesIsBlacklist" or "worldgen.oil.excludedDimensionsIsBlacklist" in order to change this.
			 * Fix a few performance issues with all ticking buildcraft tiles and a few more engine specific issues.
			 * Fix a few performance issues with the fluid pipes.
			 * Add an advancement to unlock the list recipe when you have 7 or more items in a single diamond pipe filter.
			 * Enabled several display config options by default: useBucketsStatic, useBucketsFlow, useLongLocalizedName, and changed timeGap to "seconds" rather than "ticks".
			Bug fixes:

			 * [#4297] Fixed the quarry ignoring the maximum build height when it is placed too high up.
			 * [#4317] Fix a crash with little tiles because AlexIIL didn't implement a reflection getter correctly.
			 * Fix silicon having an accidental dependency on transport. Again.
			 * Fix fluid pipes not saving the current flow direction.
			 * Fix all API names having uppercase characters. The old scheme was "BuildCraftAPI|<module>", and the new scheme is "buildcraftapi_<module>".
			 * Theoretically fix the tank and pipe fluid renderer not always getting the fluid texture correctly.
		buildcraft-all-7.99.20.jar:
			Breaking changes:

			 * The flood gate no longer uses the open sides to determine the sides to fill out in-world. (AlexIIL)
			Additions:

			 *  Re-added JSON-based assembly recipes, and made them load from "/config/buildcraft/assemblyrecipespre_mj" folder. (AlexIIL)
			 * Currently they will crash the game if any errors are detected in any of the json files - although it will print out every error before crashing.
			 * The "pre_mj" bit is important - these assembly recipe formats will change in the future MJ update, so please don't create a lot of them or you will just have to rewrite them in the future.
			 * Integration table recipes haven't been re-added though.
			 *  Added a config option for tweaking the maximum depth that the mining well, quarry, and pump can extend their tubes. (AlexIIL)
			 * This is called "general.miningMaxDepth" and can be changed from anywhere between 32 and 4096.
			 * (Values above 256 make no difference in vanilla, this is primarily for Cubic Chunk support)
			 *  Added the command "/buildcraft reload" which reloads all buildcraft data registries. (AlexIIL)
			 * In 1.13 this will be merged into the vanilla minecraft "/reload" command.
			 * This currently doesn't reload client-side registries, although you can still reload the guide page registry by using F3+T while in the guide GUI.
			 * Added an advancement for the guide book recipe.
			Improvements:

			 *  [meta] BuildCraftCompat is now included in an "all" jar file (named "buildcraft-all-7.99.20.jar").
			 * The previous "buildcraft-7.99.19" jar file has been renamed "buildcraft-main-7.99.20.jar"
			 * As such the compat module will have the same version number as the rest of buildcraft
			 * In addition it no longer has a separate changelog.
			 *  Many improvements to the guide book:
			 * The open book now shows more visibly if you are on the first or last page in the current chapter.
			 * Made the next page and previous page buttons have a much bigger clickable area.
			 * Added a second guide book for configuration information. It doesn't have a recipe because it isn't useful in the game
			 * This implies that you can add your own additional guide books, although there's not much point in doing so because addons should continue to use the main book "buildcraftcore:main"
			 * Alternative guide books can be created by running /give @a buildcraftlib:guide 1 0 {BookName: "domain:path"}
			 * Added groups: related entries. Currently these can only be specified through code.
			 * Auto-add a chapter with the name of the page entry at the very start (so that we don't need to do this manually)
			 * Auto-add the relevant groups and recipes to the end of every page entry. Recipes won't be auto-added if they have been manually specified earlier in the entry.
			 * The page title has been changed to brown rather than black, so that it stands out less than the actual text.
			Ported content:

			 * [#4299] Re-added the power requested trigger (therealfarfetchd)
			Bug fixes:

			 * Fix the quarry, pump, and mining well not digging below Y=0 when cubic chunks is installed. (AlexIIL)
			 * Slightly fix the quarry being slower than it should be - it's now a tiny bit faster than it used to be. (AlexIIL)
			 * Fixed the pump and flood gate not working correctly with gaseous fluids. (AlexIIL)
			 * [#4044] Vanilla flowing water blocks are invisible with BC installed (AlexIIL)
			 * [#4296] The marker connector recipe requires buildcraft wooden gears rather than any item that has an ore-dictionary name of "gearWood" (AlexIIL)
			 * [#4300] The obsidian pipe doesn't instantly pull in the entire stack of item entities that collide with it. (AlexIIL)
			 * [#4305] Crash when rendering inside an enderIO gui. (AlexIIL)

	Tinkers Construct (went from TConstruct-1.12.2-2.11.0.106.jar to TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.115.jar):
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.115.jar:
			The last release introduced a bug that made the Tinker Tank unusable. Now it can be used again!
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.113.jar:
			Added several checks to alloy recipes, to prevent startup if there are recipes that don't make sense and might break the game/crash. Things like vanishing fluids and/or crashes when certain liquids are in the smeltery should no longer happen with this, BUT it might be that existing mods might not start anymore, if they add broken recipes!

			 *
			Tanks/Gauges/Windows now show their contained fluid in item form again!

			 *
			Illagers now also melt into emeralds

			 *
			Display no fuel in Smeltery JEI recipe if there exists no fuel that can melt the block/item

			 *
			Several TiC furnace recipes now give XP! Like.. grout!

			 *
			Add a (very) short cooldown to rapier backpedal

			 *
			Use white glass background for clear item frame, since it's invisible with some texture packs

			 *
			Congealed slime blocks now only keep you bouncing if you land on them with a minimum speed, to prevend jittering when standing/walking on them

			 *
			Fix a weird smeltery bug where items that can't melt mess with fuel consumption or provide infinite fuel

			 *
			Add a few checks to advancements, to prevent potential crashes and/or unnecessary lag

			 *
			Fixed invalid smeltery configuration that would allow to have a smeltery controller on the floor level, which could couse crashes

			 *
			Fixes an issue where fluids are non-default then get switched to default on world load, but never had their texture loaded. You typically did not notice it with Tinkers fluids since we have so many that one is almost gaurenteed to be default, but better to be on the safe side

			 *
			Updated german localization
